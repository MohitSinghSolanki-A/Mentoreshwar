            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-2">
                <li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 3-5 days of placing the order. However, if the order has already been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated shipping, cancellation may not be entertained.</li>
                <li>We do not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers and eatables. However, a refund or replacement may be made if the customer establishes that the quality of the delivered product is not satisfactory.</li>
                <li>For damaged or defective items, please report the issue to our Customer Service team within 3-5 days of receipt. The request will be processed only after verification by the merchant.</li>
                <li>If you feel that the product received does not match the site description or your expectations, you must notify our customer service within 3-5 days of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team will review your complaint and take an appropriate decision.</li>
                <li>For products that come with a manufacturer's warranty, please refer the issue directly to the manufacturer.</li>
                <li>For approved refunds, Rajat Singh Solanki will process the refund within 3-5 business days.</li>
